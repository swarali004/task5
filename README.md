In this project, I analyzed the Titanic dataset using Python to explore passenger details and survival patterns. I used Pandas for data cleaning and exploration, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations.

I started by loading the dataset and checking its structure using functions like .head(), .info(), and .describe(). Then, I explored different features such as passenger class, age, and fare, and created visualizations to understand their relationships.
